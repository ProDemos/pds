        <h1>Design System for ProDemos.nl</h1>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide a single visual source for the design elements of ProDemos.nl.</li>
            <li>Serve components and assets for the actual ProDemos.nl website to prevent code duplication.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <p>In this design system we use the following techniques:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS3 build with SASS</li>
            <li>Twig 2 templates</li>
            <li>Typescript for Javascript</li>
            <li>SVGs for icons and images where possible</li>
            <li>All of the code is in Git version control</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to use this design system?</h2>

        <p>To include the design system in your own project, look at the README in github. It contains two
        parts: <code>assets</code> and <code>demo</code>. You are currently reading <code>demo/html/index.html</code>.
        For your own project, you only need the assets folder; it contains css, fonts etcetera, but also Twig
        components you can reuse in your own project. It may contain Vue components later.<p>


        <p>In general,</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Including main.css</b> before your own css will not change anything to your design. At least
                one of the elements on your page should use one of the classes defined in the design system to 
                actually use the design system. For example, adding the 'default' scope and 'corporate' theme 
                to your body (<code>&lt;body class="s-default t-corporate"&gt;</code>) will already inherit 
                things like font styles.
            </li>
            <li><b>Scopes</b> can be specified by <code>class="s-{scope}"</code>. Scope will be inherited, and 
            it can affect regular content like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>.</li>
            <li><b>Themes</b> can be specified by <code>class="t-{theme}"</code>. Theme will be inherited, so
            you can start with a <code>&lt;body class="t-corporate"&gt;</code> to have the whole page in the corporate theme.
            The theme will mainly affect the design of components below it.</li>
            <li><b>Components</b> have a <code>class="c-{component}"</code> and subcomponents may
            have classes like <code>class="c-{component}-{subcomponent}"</code>. The classes may contain modifiers, like 'primary'
            or 'disabled'; such modifiers should only mean something inside the component.
            </li>
            
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design elements</h2>
        <p>The section Design Elements contains the colors, icons and basic typography.</p>

        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p>Here you can find the logo's, button, form elements, navigation elements and tables.</p>
        
        <h2>Sass</h2>
        <p>Little notes on the use of the Sass-files when adding styles</p>
        <p>The variables are defined by scales, which helps in consistency for sizings and layout. A scale can be accessed like an array, so when the font-size scale contains multiple value's, you can access one by:</p>
        <pre>
$type-scale: 56px 44px 32px 24px 22px 18px 16px 14px 12px;<br>
.class {
    font-size: nth($type-scale, 2); // second in the array, gives 44px
}
        </pre>

        <h4>Breakpoints</h4>
        <p>When breakpoints are defined, they can be used inline in the class to target specific behaviour.<br>Just use:<br>
        <pre>
@include media-from(lg) {
    font-size: nth($type-scale, 2);
}
        </pre> to set another style from breakpoint LG (LarGe, probably something around 1024px)</p>
        <p>
            Three types can be used:<br>
        <pre>@include media-from(lg){ ... }</pre>
        Which means: 'Use this style up from Large screens'
        <pre>@include media-between(md, lg) { ... }</pre>
        Which means: 'use this style between Medium and Large screens'
        <pre>@include media-until(lg) { ... }</pre>
        Which means: 'use this style until Large screens'
        </p>


        <h2>Code base</h2>
        <h3>Code source</h3>
        <p>The source code of the design system is available on GitHub: https://github.com/ProDemos/design-system</p>
        <p>Use Git to fetch the source code (<code>git clone git@github.com:ProDemos/design-system.git</code>) and follow the steps in the <code>README.md</code> file to setup the project.</p>
