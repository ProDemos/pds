    <h2 class="c-copy--h2">Icons</h2>
    <p>
        The icons for buttons are based on SVG with a canvas size of 24 x 24, and when you create new icons the 
        line art is preferably max 22 x 22 px. If you stick to these numbers the icons will render consistently. 
        Copy the SVG-code and alter just the width and height to your need when using it in your project. 
        They are scalable, so you can make them larger than the default 24 x 24.
            The icons that can be used as graphical element on the background are default 48 x 48 px.<br><br>
        Most of these icons will be defined as icon components too, so look in that chapter on how to use them properly. 
        If icons don't show up here, you may be looking on http://localhost ?
